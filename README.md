Csound wrapper for Unity3d

CsoundUnity is a fully integrated audio middleware for the Unity(3D) game engine based in C#. It extends Unity's audio API by creating Csound-based AudioSource objects that can interact and exist alongside regular AudioSource objects. With CsoundUnity, games developers have at their fingertips one of the most powerful synthesis systems in existence.

This simple wrapper is based on Richard Henninger's Csound6Net .NET wrapper. If you wish to use the Csound API in a model that is idiomatic to .net please use his wrapper instead. http://csound6net.codeplex.com
